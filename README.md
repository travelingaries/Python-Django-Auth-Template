## Run on local
- Make sure you have a new Python virtual environment set up. (If you do not have a virtual environment manager, on the Mac, you can follow the beginning steps on [Creating Virtual Environments with Pyenv](https://akrabat.com/creating-virtual-environments-with-pyenv/) or [How to install Django using virtualenv](https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215317948-How-to-install-Django-using-virtualenv) to set up a pyenv virtualenv. Once you've created a virtualenv, run it using `pyenv activate {env_name}`). This app is meant to run on Python 3.
- Make sure you have Django installed in your virtual environment. (If you do not have Django installed, run `pip3 install django`). You can run `python -c "import django; print(django.get_version())"` to see the version of Django installed.
- run `python manage.py runserver`
